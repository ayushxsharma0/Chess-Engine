## General info
This repository consists of the chess engine which I developed as my final year project during B.Tech in CSE. It consists both the options i.e. to play vs an AI or vs a human being.
When we launch the app we get the main screen where we can choose if we want to play against an AI or against a human. Currently the depth into which the AI can see the future moves is set as 3 in the code, as python is quite a slow language so if we increase the depth time taken by the AI to make a move increases quite a bit.

The playlist mentioned below helped me a lot during the development of this project and I will recommend it to anyone who wanna develop a chess engine in python.
